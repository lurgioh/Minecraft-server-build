# 🎮 Pixelmon Server Setup (AMP + Playit.gg)

This is my full single-section write-up for creating a Pixelmon Minecraft server using CubeCoders AMP for management and Playit.gg for public access — no port forwarding required. I started with a fresh Debian install 🐧 and set a static IP (192.168.1.236). After updating with `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`, I installed AMP by running `curl -sSL https://getamp.sh | bash`. Then I accessed AMP in my browser at `https://192.168.1.236:8080`, logged in, and activated my license under Configuration → New Instance Defaults → License Key. I created a new Minecraft Java Edition (Forge) instance called “Pixelmon,” opened Configuration → Server and Startup, set Server Type to Forge, Release Stream to Stable, and Forge Version to 36.2.40 for Minecraft 1.16.5, then clicked Download/Update to install it ⚙️.

Because Pixelmon works best on Java 8–11 ☕, I installed Java 11 (Temurin) with `sudo apt install wget gnupg apt-transport-https -y`, then added the Adoptium repo and installed Temurin-11-JRE. I found the path with `readlink -f $(which java)` and set it in AMP under Configuration → Java and Memory → Java Path (`/usr/lib/jvm/temurin-11-jre-amd64/bin/java`). After saving and restarting, the server launched successfully.

Next, I downloaded Pixelmon Reforged (1.16.5) from [https://reforged.gg](https://reforged.gg) 🧩, opened AMP’s File Manager, went into the `/mods` folder, and uploaded the Pixelmon JAR (for example, `Pixelmon-1.16.5-9.1.11-universal.jar`). I restarted the server and waited for the console to show `[Pixelmon] Pixelmon Reforged initializing...` followed by “Done!”, confirming it was ready.

To make the server public without touching my router, I installed Playit.gg 🌐 using `sudo apt install playit -y` and started it with `playit`. It gave me a link like `https://playit.gg/claim/XXXX`; I opened it in my browser to link my server. On the Playit dashboard, I created a tunnel with Protocol = TCP, Local Address = 192.168.1.236, and Local Port = 25565. Playit generated a public address (like `national-kenneth.na.joinmc.link`) that anyone could use to connect 🎉. If it ever got stuck asking to claim again, I deleted its data with `rm -rf ~/.playit` and re-linked. When Playit showed “Connected to Playit network” and listed my tunnel mapping to 192.168.1.236:25565, I knew it was live ✅.

To increase Pokémon spawn rates 🐾, I opened AMP’s File Manager → config → pixelmon → spawning.yml and changed `global: spawnRate: 1.0` to `global: spawnRate: 2.0`, doubling the spawns. After saving and restarting, I confirmed spawns were higher with `/checkspawns` in-game. For backups 💾, I always went to AMP → Backups → Create New Backup before shutting down. AMP created a ZIP of the entire world, mods, and configs. Sometimes I manually copied backups with `cp /home/AMP_Instances/Pixelmon/backups/*.zip /home/harrison/backups/`. You can also automate this under Configuration → Scheduled Tasks → Add New Task → Perform Backup.

For monitoring 🧊, I installed `lm-sensors` with `sudo apt install lm-sensors -y`, ran `sudo sensors-detect`, and used `sensors` to check temps — most CPUs idled around 40°C–45°C. I used `watch -n 2 sensors` for live updates and installed Netdata (`bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)`) to view system performance at `http://192.168.1.236:19999`. This helped track CPU, RAM, and temperature while the server was running.

If something broke, here’s what I learned from troubleshooting 🔧: “Connection forcibly closed” meant Playit wasn’t connected or the server wasn’t fully started; Java errors meant AMP wasn’t using Java 11; missing mods meant the Pixelmon JAR wasn’t in `/mods`; and low spawn rates meant `spawnRate` needed a bump. For performance, I set Java memory in AMP to Initial = 2G and Max = 4–6G to keep it smooth.

In the end, this setup gave me a stable, fully-managed Pixelmon Reforged server controlled through AMP’s web dashboard, accessible worldwide via Playit.gg, with backups, monitoring, and proper Java configuration — all running efficiently on Debian. It’s simple, fast, and perfect for hosting with friends or testing mods without worrying about network issues. 🚀
